# Python Tests

A simple repository for my personal python learning tests...


### Install dependency pip libraries:

```bash
pip3.6 install glob2
pip3.6 install pandas
pip3.6 install numpy
pip3.6 install ipython
pip3.6 install xlrd
pip3.6 install jupyter
pip3.6 install geopy
pip3.6 install folium
```

install opencv to MAC

```bash
pip3.6 install opencv-python==3.3.0.10
brew install gtk+
brew install opencv
```

### Troubleshooting

I need to know available versions of a pip module? I.e. `opencv-python`:

```bash
pip3.6 install opencv-python==
```

### Execute Jupyter notebook on MAC OS

For data analysis I am using Jupyter. You can find more information here:

http://jupyter.org

To open Jupyter files on MAC type:

```bash
cd PROJECT_DIR
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/jupyter notebook
```

Then go to the files tree and select the jupyter (.ipynb) file to edit.
